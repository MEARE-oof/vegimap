
The api helps handle requests.
Think of them as function that you call from the client to the server.
The server then does something and returns a response to the client.

In order to use the api, you need to know the endpoint of the api.

also, here's a template for requests:
fetch("/api/endpoint", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        //data
    })
}).then(res => {
    if (res.ok) {
        return res.json();
    } else {
        throw new Error();
    }
}).then(data => {
    // do something with the data
}).catch(err => {
    // do something with the error
});
